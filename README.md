IoT-Home-Sensor-Security-Framework
A secure IoT framework for home sensor data integrating authentication, cloud security, and intrusion prevention. Implements SHA-256 for integrity verification, Random Forest for intrusion detection, and rule-based decision systems with cloud integration to enhance data security and resilience in smart home environments.

IoT Home Sensor Security Framework 🔒

📖 Overview
This project presents a Secure Framework for Authentication and Integration for IoT-based home sensor data.  
It focuses on protecting smart home devices from cyber threats by integrating machine learning, cryptography, and cloud-based security mechanisms.

The framework combines:
- SHA-256 for secure authentication and data integrity.
- Random Forest for intrusion detection.
- Rule-Based Decision System (RBD) and Decentralized Information Sharing (DIS) for collaborative threat prevention.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) for continuous monitoring and adaptive defense.
- Cloud Integration with secure upload and encrypted logs for incident response.

⚙️ Features
✅ Intrusion detection using Random Forest ML algorithm  
✅ SHA-256 hashing for secure authentication  
✅ Cloud-based storage for logs and threat intelligence  
✅ User alerts and automatic attack isolation  
✅ Continuous learning with reinforcement algorithms  
✅ Rule-based and decentralized decision systems  

🧩 System Workflow
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing — Collect IoT home sensor data (temperature, motion, door/window logs).
2. Training — Use Random Forest for learning normal vs anomalous patterns.
3. Intrusion Detection — Apply rule-based checks and information sharing between IoT devices.
4. Adaptation — Reinforcement learning continuously improves detection.
5. Cloud Security — Authenticate using SHA-256; upload activity logs securely.
6. Attack Mitigation — Isolate affected devices, alert users, and analyze attack data.
